# Fulstack-Intern-Coading-Challenge
This full-stack web app uses React.js, Express.js, and MySQL to manage store ratings. It supports three roles: Admin, Store Owner, and User. Admins manage users, stores, and view dashboards; Store Owners see average ratings and feedback; Users can register, log in, search stores, and submit or update ratings with secure validations.
